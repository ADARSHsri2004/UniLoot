### 🔧 Recent changes (Oct 21, 2025)

- backend: updated `package.json` dev script to `src/server.ts` and made MongoDB connection optional (guarded when `MONGO_URI` not set).
- backend: updated `src/app.ts` to avoid failing start when `MONGO_URI` is missing/invalid.
- frontend: added `Browse.tsx` and `Sell.tsx` pages and registered routes in `App.tsx`.
- frontend: updated `Home.tsx` to call `navigate('/browse')` and `navigate('/sell')`.

### ✅ Health checks performed (local)

- Pulled latest code from `origin/main` — success
- Started backend dev server (logs show `Server running on port 5000`) — success (skips DB connect when MONGO_URI missing)
- Started frontend dev server (Vite) on `http://localhost:8080/` — success

---

### � Next recommended tasks

1. If you need database-backed features locally, set `MONGO_URI` in `backend/.env` to a valid MongoDB connection string (mongodb:// or mongodb+srv://).
2. Wire frontend product listing/detail pages to backend APIs (controllers/routes were added in the recent pull).
3. Add tests or a small smoke-test script that pings `/api/health` and the frontend root.
